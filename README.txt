To setup application 
1) Use the pos_schema inside final Application/Database Setup and setup MySQL database.
2) To set password for db connection as per your mysql password you must update db.java file and then clean and build to .jar file and then convert to .exe using Launch4j.
3) 2) Use "root" as username and "mayank" as password in case you want to run application directly without changing db.java (in case you don't want step 2).
